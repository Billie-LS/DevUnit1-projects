/*
Experiment with this loop by modifying each of the following: 
the variable initialization, 
the boolean condition, 
and the update expression.
*/

// Declare a variable 'i' and initialize it to 0.
// The loop will start from the value assigned to 'i'.
for (let i = 0; i < 51; i++) {
   console.log(i);  // Log the current value of 'i' to the console.
   // Increment the value of 'i' by 1 in each iteration.
   // The loop will continue as long as 'i' is less than 51.
 }

// Output:
// 0
// 1
// 2
// ...
// 50
