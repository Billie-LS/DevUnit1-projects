// undefined is a primitive data type in JavaScript
// assigned to declared variables which have not been initialized.

let x;
console.log(x) // expected return undefined

// null similar to undefined in that represents an unknown value, however, 
// it is assigned to values that the programmer wishes to keep empty.

let y = null;
console.log(y);  // expected return null

console.log(typeof x);
